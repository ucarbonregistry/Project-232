Tumakuru Biodiesel Production from Waste Oil, Fat and Biomass

CDM UNFCCC Methodology Large-scale Consolidated Methodology
ACM 0017: Production of biofuel, Version 04.0

The project Tumakuru Biodiesel Production From Waste Oil, Fat And Biomass is located at
Survey No: 252, Road No. 1, 2nd Phase, Vasanthanaraspura Industrial Area, District: Tumakuru,
State: Karnataka, Pin Code: 572128, Country: India.

Purpose of the project activity:
Eco Green Fuels Pvt Ltd (EGFPL) is the project proponent (PP) for the project activity and
specializes in manufacturing biodiesel using used cooking oil (UCO), waste animal fats and other
biowastes (biomass) which are locally sourced to prepare biodiesel via a process called
transesterification. The project activity is a biofuel production plant – which is the plant where
feedstock (e.g. oil, waste oil/fat sugar, starch) is processed to biofuel.
The project activity was commissioned in 2011 and involves the construction and operation of a
biofuel production plant for producing (blended) biofuel that is used as fuel in existing stationary
installations (e.g. diesel generators) and in vehicles within India. The project activity is hence a
renewable energy project activity that displaces more-GHG-intensive fossil fuel for combustion
in vehicles and stationary installations. The UCO’s chemical properties make it suitable for both
renewable diesel and biodiesel production.
